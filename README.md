# Rust — Text Editor for Android 

A simple, lightweight text editor with a few practical features.  
Designed for everyday notes, drafts, and personal writing.

## Features

1. Fast text replacement and case-insensitive, symbol-tolerant search.  
2. Text protection using **AES-256 GCM** encryption with 75,000 iterations.  
3. Basic editing tools: **Undo / Redo**, **Copy / Paste**.  
4. **Screenshot blocking** for enhanced privacy.  
5. Adjustable font size and text color options — **amber**, **green**, **white**.

## Important

The app is signed with a **test signature** for technical reasons. If you are concerned, you can rebuild the APK manually. Since the signature itself does not protect against tampering, a standard test one was used.

It is recommended to download the APK from **syndes rep** or from the **Releases** section of this repository. Despite using a test signature, the app is a **release build** with debugging disabled.
